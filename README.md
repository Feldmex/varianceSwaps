This repository is the first attempt at on chain variance swaps on ethereum using chainlink price feeds.

The master branch contains all the core functionality of the project except the oracle which is a dummy oracle to make testing of other functionality easier.

The kovan branch contains the same core functionality of the master branch, except the tests from the master branch.

The kovan branch also contains the oracle used in production which interacts with chainlink aggregators.
